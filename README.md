# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refractor

**Description**

This week's challenge was to refractor code so that the application for Horiseon met accessibility standards. This was accomplished by organizing semantic HTML elements and placing those in a logical order, consolidating portions of the stylesheet by grouping code with similar properties, and even changing the title of the website from "website" to "Horiseon".
